        <p>About 200 to 2,000 species of both plants and animals go extinct each year. An endangered species is a type of organism that faces the threat of extinction primarily due to 2 reasons.</p>
        <ol>   
            <li>Loss of Habitat</li>
            <li>Loss of genetic variaton</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>Each of these reasons will be discussed further down the page<br>Click <a href="about.html">here</a> to know more about our organisation or to contact us</p>

        <p><strong>Loss of Habitat</strong>: A habitat is defined as a place where an organism lives naturally. If an organism loses its Habitat, it becomes exposed to various biotic and abiotic factors that can lead to extinction in a long run. Loss of habitat can be due to </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Natural Changes: Sometimes, habitat loss occurs naturally. For instance, nonavian dinosaurs lost their habitat around 65 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. The climate changed rapidly, likely due to an asteroid impact, leading to their extinction.</li>
            <li>Human Activity: Human actions significantly contribute to habitat loss. Urban development, agriculture, and industry reduce the habitat available for native organisms. For example, the Amazon rainforest in South America has lost vast acres due to logging, cattle ranching, and urban expansion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Loss of Genetic Variation</strong>: When a population becomes small, genetic diversity decreases. This lack of variation makes the species vulnerable to diseases, environmental changes, and other threats.</p>
        <p>You might wonder, why is it important to discuss endangered species? below are the following reasons why you and I should be worried about the rate of extinction.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Biodiversity: Each species plays a unique role in ecosystems. Losing species disrupts these delicate balances, affecting everything from nutrient cycling to pollination. Imagine a puzzle missing pieces—it won't function properly.</li>
            <li>Ecological Services: Species provide essential services like oxygen production, water purification, and pest control. For instance, bees pollinate crops, ensuring food security.</li>
            <li>Human Health: Many medicines come from natural sources. Losing species means losing potential cures. Additionally, healthy ecosystems reduce disease risks.</li>
            <li>Aesthetic and Cultural Value: Species inspire art, literature, and cultural practices. Their existence enriches our lives.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now, that we have seen the reasons for conservation of species. Our next question should be how can we participate in conservation?
        <ol>
            <li>Learn and Educate:
                Educate yourself about endangered species, ecosystems, and conservation methods. Understand the challenges they face.
                Share your knowledge with others, friends, family, and social media followers. Awareness matters!</li>
            <li>Support Conservation Organizations:
                Contribute to reputable organizations working on conservation projects. Donations help fund research, habitat restoration, and education programs.
                Consider supporting local initiatives that focus on specific species or ecosystems.</li>
            <li>Volunteer:
                Participate in local conservation events, tree-planting drives, or wildlife surveys.
                Volunteer at wildlife rehabilitation centers or sanctuaries.</li>
            <li>Reduce Your Ecological Footprint:
                Conserve water, reduce energy consumption, and minimize waste.
                Choose sustainable products and support eco-friendly businesses.</li>
            <li>Advocate for Policy Changes:
                Write to your representatives about environmental issues.
                Support policies that protect habitats and endangered species.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A little bit of extra knowledge for you, the top most endagered species is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Armur Leopard<br>First on the list of the world's most endangered animals in 2022 is the amur leopard. Between 2014 and 2015, only around 92 individuals were left in their natural range. This number is now estimated to be around 84. They are extremely vulnerable to poachers, who kill them for their coats and bones, the latter of which is sold for use in traditional Asian medicine. They are at risk of habitat loss due to natural and man-made fires. Climate change is also leading to a decrease in prey availability.</li>
